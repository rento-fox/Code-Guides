// TypeScript Special Types
    // TypeScript has special types that may not refer to any specific type of data.

// Type: any
    // any is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.
    // The example below does not use any and will throw an error:
        let u = true;
        // u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
        // u.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Property 'runANonExistentMethod' does not exist on type 'boolean'.
        // console.log(Math.round(u)); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
    
    // Setting any to the special type any disables type checking:
        let v: any = true;
        v = "string"; // no error as it can be "any" type
        // v.runANonExistentMethod(); // no type error in the editor, but will still throw an error if not commented
        console.log(Math.round(v)); // NaN
    
    // any can be a useful way to get past errors since it disables type checking, but TypeScript will not be able provide type safety,
    // and tools which rely on type data, such as auto completion will not work. Remember, it should be avoided at "any" cost... 

// Type: unknown
    // unknown is a similar, but safer alternative to any.
    // TypeScript will prevent unknown types from being used, as shown in the below example:
        let w: unknown = 1; 
        w = "string"; // no error
        w = { 
            runANonExistentMethod: () => {
                console.log("I think therefore I am"); // I think therefore I am
            }
        } as { runANonExistentMethod: () => void }

        // How can we avoid the error for the code commented out below when we don't know the type? 
        // w.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'. 

        if (typeof w === 'object' && w !== null) {
            (w as { runANonExistentMethod: Function }).runANonExistentMethod(); 
        } 
        // Although we have to cast multiple times we can do a check in the if to secure our type and have a safer casting
    
    // Compare the example above to the previous example, with any.

    // unknown is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. To add a type later, you'll need to cast it.
    // Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say property or variable is of the casted type.

// Type: never
    // never effectively throws an error whenever it is defined.
        // let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.
    
    // never is rarely used, especially by itself, its primary use is in advanced generics.

// Type: undefined & null
    // undefined and null are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives undefined and null respectively.
        let y: undefined = undefined;
        let z: null = null;
        console.log(typeof y); // undefined
        console.log(typeof z); // object
    
    // These types don't have much use unless strictNullChecks is enabled in the tsconfig.json file.

// EOF
