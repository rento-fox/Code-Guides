# Variables in Programming

Variables are one of the most basic and essential concepts in programming, used to store values.

## What is a Variable?
A variable has a name, and you can store something in it.

The image below shows how we can think of a variable named `favFruit`, with the value `'apple'` stored inside it.

Below is how we can create the `favFruit` variable, using Python code.

The code above creates a variable named favFruit, and the equal sign = is used to store the value 'apple' inside the variable.<br>
The reason for giving a variable a name is to be able to use it later in the code, and also to know what value it holds.
