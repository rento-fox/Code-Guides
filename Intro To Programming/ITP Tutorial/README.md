The following pages explain the basic programming concepts, using code examples, images, and animations.

## Who Is This For?
These pages are for anyone who wants a clear explanation of one or more programming concepts.

Whether you're a total beginner or someone who needs to revisit a programming concept,<br>
these pages will help you understand how code works at a fundamental level.

Looking through the code examples, you can see for yourself that the concepts are the same<br>
